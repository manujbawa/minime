## üîå IDE Integration

### Cursor IDE Integration

1. **Configure MCP Connection (HTTP - Recommended)**
   ```json
   // In Cursor settings (claude_desktop_config.json)
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "minime": {
         "transport": {
           "type": "sse",
           "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/sse"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Alternative: stdio (Legacy)**
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "minime": {
         "command": "docker",
         "args": ["exec", "-i", "minime-mcp", "node", "/app/src/server.js", "--stdio"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **How It Works in Cursor**
   - You chat with Claude while working on code
   - Claude has access to your current file context AND MCP tools
   - When you ask for structured thinking, Claude uses MCP tools to create/store thoughts
   - Each thought can reference specific code lines, files, or selections
   - The thinking process is preserved for future sessions

3. **Benefits in Cursor**
   - üìù **Persistent Context**: Claude remembers previous conversations and decisions
   - üîç **Smart Code Review**: Reference past architectural decisions
   - üí° **Pattern Suggestions**: Get recommendations based on your coding history
   - üß† **Structured Problem-Solving**: Work through complex issues step-by-step

### VS Code Integration

1. **Install MCP Extension** (when available)
2. **Configure Connection (HTTP - Recommended)**
   ```json
   // In VS Code settings  
   {
     "mcp.servers": {
       "minime": {
         "transport": {
           "type": "sse",
           "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/sse"
         }
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   **Alternative: stdio (Legacy)**
   ```json
   {
     "mcp.servers": {
       "minime": {
         "command": "docker exec -i minime-mcp node /app/src/server.js --stdio"
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Benefits in VS Code**
   - üîó **Contextual AI**: AI assistants with access to project memory
   - üìä **Pattern Insights**: View coding patterns directly in the editor
   - üéØ **Focused Suggestions**: Recommendations based on your specific context

### **Practical Example: How Sequential Thinking Works**

```
1. You're in Cursor editing UserService.js
2. You select a problematic function and ask:
   "This function is causing performance issues. Help me debug it systematically."

3. Claude responds:
   "I'll create a thinking sequence to debug this systematically."
   
   [Uses start_thinking_sequence MCP tool]
   
4. Claude adds thoughts referencing your code:
   Thought 1 (Analysis): "Looking at UserService.js:67-89, the getUserProfile 
   function makes 3 separate database calls instead of using a JOIN."
   
   Thought 2 (Hypothesis): "The N+1 query problem is causing the performance issue.
   Each user lookup triggers additional queries for roles and preferences."
   
   Thought 3 (Action): "I should rewrite this to use a single query with JOINs."
   
   [Each thought stored via add_thought MCP tool]

5. Later sessions can reference this thinking:
   "What was my analysis of the UserService performance issue?"
   
   Claude: [Retrieves the thinking sequence and shows the systematic analysis]
```

**Key Point**: The IDE provides context, you initiate the structured thinking through conversation, and MCP stores the process for future reference.

### **HTTP vs stdio MCP Benefits**

#### **HTTP-based MCP (Recommended)**
- ‚úÖ **Multiple Clients**: Several team members can connect simultaneously  
- ‚úÖ **Network Access**: Access from different machines on the network
